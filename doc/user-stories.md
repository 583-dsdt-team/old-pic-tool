## User Stories

> In class assignment from 11-01-22

Considerations:
* Who is the user?
* What do they want to do with the tool?
* What needs and desires do they have for the tool?
* What is their skill level?

**User 1: Peter**

Peter is a professor in the social sciences. He wants to use this tool to probabilistically derive skin tone from old photographs for research. Peter needs the tool to output a dataframe that is clearly documented and easy to interpret. Peter is a skilled researcher who can upload images and interpret output in the form of a spreadsheet but not troubleshoot technical issues with the code.

**User 2: Technical researcher**

This user is looking for a place to start in identifying skin tone from old photos, but will go on to build their own method. This user will use our tool to produce a set of priors about their own set of photos, but will go on to build their own model. They will feed their own pictures in to the model and receive a basic guess about each person's skin tone, which will inform their own work moving forward. This person will likely be looking at the code comprising specific components of the tool. They are a highly skilled programmer and will be adapting or using our code moving forward.

**User 3: Basic researcher**

This user is looking for to use our method for identifying skin tone from old photos in their own research. The user is looking for an out-of-the-box method and will not be adapting any code. This user will use our tool to produce estimates that they will use in their own research. They will need to feed their own pictures in and receive a basic guess about each person's skin tone.  They are a skilled researcher but not necessarily a skilled programmer.
