**User 1: Social scientist**

"Peter" is a professional in the social sciences who wants to derive probabilistic skin tone from old photographs for research. He uses our repository to upload images and output a spreadsheet with probable skin tones for each photo. He will use this as a tool to output a dataframe that is clearly documented and easy to export, graph, and interpret, but will not adjust the code and would struggle in troubleshooting technical issues.

**User 2: Technical researcher**

"Sally" is a researcher who is developing her own methods of detecting skin tone in non-color photos. She uses our two methods as a starting point to inspire her work. She develops her own methods, and uses our effectiveness assessment framework to test how well her methods perform.
